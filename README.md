# Portfolio



## descripton:
 a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
 
 
I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
If I load the portfolio, I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them.
If I click one of the links in the navigation, the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
If I click on the link to the section about their work, the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications.
If I am presented with the developer's first application, that application's image should be larger in size than the others. 
If I click on the images of the applications, I am taken to that deployed application
If resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices, I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
